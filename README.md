# Overview
The movie recommendation system is designed to provide users with personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and the similarity of movie features. It leverages movie metadata including genres, keywords, cast, and crew to suggest similar movies. The system calculates cosine similarity between movie tags to determine similarity and recommends movies based on user input.
